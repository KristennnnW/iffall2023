        <p>Remember when we first met?
            <br>
            You said, "Light my cigarette"
            <br>
            So I lied to my mom and dad
            <br>
            And jumped the fence and I ran
            <br>
            But we couldn't go very far
            <br>
            'Cause you locked your keys in your car
            <br>
            So you sat and stared at my lips
            <br>
            And I could already feel your kiss
            <br>
            Long nights, daydreams
            <br>
            Sugar and smoke rings, I've been a fool
            <br>
            But strawberries and cigarettes always taste like you
            <br>
            Headlights, on me
            <br>
            Racing to sixty, I've been a fool
            <br>
            But strawberries and cigarettes always taste like
            <br>
            Blue eyes, black jeans
            <br>
            Lighters and candy, I've been a fool
            <br>
            But strawberries and cigarettes always taste like you
            <br>
            Remember when you taught me fate
            <br>
            Said it'd all be worth the wait
            <br>
            Like that night in the back of the cab
            <br>
            When your fingers walked in my hand
            <br>
            Next day, nothing on my phone
            <br>
            But I can still smell you on my clothes
            <br>
            Always hoping that things would change
            <br>
            But we went right back to your games
            <br>
            Long nights, daydreams
            <br>
            Sugar and smoke rings, I've been a fool
            <br>
            But strawberries and cigarettes always taste like you
            <br>
            Headlights, on me
            <br>
            Racing to sixty, I've been a fool
            <br>
            But strawberries and cigarettes always taste like
            <br>
            Blue eyes, black jeans
            <br>
            Lighters and candy, I've been a fool
            <br>
            But strawberries and cigarettes always taste like you
            <br>
            And even if I run away
            <br>
            And give my heart a holiday
            <br>
            Still strawberries and cigarettes always taste like you
            <br>
            You always leave me wanting more
            <br>
            I can't shake my hunger for
            <br>
            Strawberries and cigarettes always taste like you
            <br>
            Yeah, they always taste like you
            <br>
            You
            <br>
            Long nights, daydreams
            <br>
            With that sugar and smoke rings
            <br>
            Always taste like you
            <br>
            Headlights, on me (And even if I run away)
            <br>
            Racing to sixty, I've been a fool (And give my heart a holiday)
            <br>
            Still, strawberries and cigarettes always taste like
            <br>
            Blue eyes, black jeans (You always leave me wanting more)
            <br>
            Lighters and candy, I've been a fool (I can't shake my hunger for)
            <br>
            Strawberries and cigarettes always taste like you.</p>
