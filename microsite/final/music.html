In her pursuit of him, she gets her bangs cut and encourages herself to look cute, all the while hoping he'd notice. Her love is pure; she loves him not because she is in love with being in love, but because she genuinely likes him, to such an extent she can't even bring herself to look him in the eye and feels like melting to simply be with him.">

Another common interpretation is about the girl being bullied, being shunned or failing constantly, leading the girl to commit suicide.">

Despite having an upbeat, oriental track, the song contains rather dark themes, mentioning guillotines and ICBMs. In addition, the lyrics state things such as Songs of lament go unheard (嘆ク唄モ聞コエナイヨ) and This is a banquet inside a steel jail cell (此処は宴　鋼の檻).">

This song is about a girl who demands love and attention from other people as an effect of a cursed collar she wears. As she grows up, the collar's effect on her becomes stronger, making her end up feeling unsatisfied and continues to demand more love and attention from others, believing that the people whom she demands from are not enough. Another interpretation is that it is about a girl who wants love from her parents. Her parents want her to do well in school and do not give her the love she so desires. The collar she wears is a symbol of her parents' expectations. As she grows up and her body changes, the collar stays the same size just as what her parents want out of her doesn't change either.">

    <p>In August 2010, over 22,000 original songs had been written under the name Hatsune Miku. Later reports confirmed that she had 100,000 songs 2011 to her name.[citation needed] Crypton's website promotes Miku's popularity by having her voice used in over 100,000 unique songs.[93]
        One of the Vocaloid compilations, Exit Tunes Presents Vocalogenesis feat. Hatsune Miku, debuted at number one on the Japanese weekly Oricon album charts dated May 31, 2010, becoming the first Vocaloid album ever to top the charts.[94] Another album, Supercell, by the group Supercell[95][96] also features a number of songs using Vocaloids. Other albums, such as 19's Sound Factory's First Sound Story[97] and Livetune's Re:package, and Re:Mikus[98][99] also feature Miku's voice. Other uses of Miku include the albums Sakura no Ame (桜ノ雨) by Absorb and Miku no Kanzume (みくのかんづめ) by OSTER-project. The viral Nyan Cat meme featured an Utau cover of "Nyanyanyanyan!" by Daniell-P, the original song featuring Miku. Another song originally using Miku, "Color", was covered by MARiA, and featured as the opening theme of the 2011 anime series Freezing.
