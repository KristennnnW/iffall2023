                <h2>Hatsune Miku</h2>
                <p>
                    Hatsune Miku (Japanese: 初音ミク) is a Vocaloid software voicebank developed by 
                    Crypton Future Media and its official anthropomorphic mascot character, a 16-year-old girl 
                    with long, turquoise twintails. Miku's personification has been marketed as a virtual idol, 
                    and has performed at live virtual concerts onstage as an animated projection (rear-cast projection
                     on a specially coated glass screen).
                </p>
                <p><strong>Hatsune Miku</strong> was developed by Crypton Future Media as the face for their Vocaloid singing synthesizer 
                    software. Her creation was aimed at providing a relatable and interactive character for a piece of technology 
                    that could revolutionize how music was made, allowing users to synthesize singing by inputting lyrics and melody. 
                    The intention was to blend a commercial product with a cultural icon, sparking creativity among users who would 
                    then contribute to Miku's growing library of songs. Miku was designed to be a catalyst for community-building and 
                    creative expression, with an intentionally minimal backstory to encourage fans to create and define her story through
                     their art and music. Her overwhelming success has not only turned her into a virtual pop star with a worldwide 
                     following but also established a new model for interactive digital media and community-driven content creation.</p>
