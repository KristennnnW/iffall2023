                    <strong>Hatsune Miku: Project DIVA f </strong>
                    <p>A PlayStation 3 version of the game, titled Hatsune Miku: Project DIVA F (Japanese: 初音ミク -Project DIVA- F) (the only difference being the title uses a capital F is used as opposed to the original Vita version's lowercase f) was released on March 7, 2013.[1] This version was released physically and digitally in North America on August 27, 2013, making it the first game in the Project DIVA series to be released in the West.[8] It was originally scheduled to be released in Europe at the same time, but instead released one week later, on September 4, 2013 as a digital download-only title. The PlayStation Vita version was later released in North America and Europe in March 2014, both as digital download-only titles as well.[9] This therefore makes it the first game in the series to be multi-platform, with it being developed simultaneously for the PlayStation Vita and PlayStation 3, though there are some differences with regards to control schemes.</p>
                    <p>The game retains the same basic gameplay mechanics from the series albeit with several new changes, most notably the addition of the "Star" symbol to the game's existing symbols of cross, circle, square, triangle and arrows. The "Star" symbol represents the "Scratch" move where instead of pressing the face buttons as usual, players rub the screen or flick the analogue stick, depending on which system is being used</p>

                    <strong>Hatsune miku: colorful stage!</strong>
                    <p>Hatsune Miku: Colorful Stage!, known in Japan as Project Sekai: Colorful Stage! feat. Hatsune Miku (Japanese: プロジェクトセカイ カラフルステージ！ feat.初音ミク, Hepburn: Purojekuto Sekai Karafuru Sutēji! fīcharingu Hatsune Miku), abbreviated to PJSK or Proseka, subtitled Brand New World from its 3rd anniversary, is a rhythm game developed by Colorful Palette, a studio of CyberAgent's Craft Egg, who also was involved in development before it shifted to Colorful Palette, and published by Sega Corporation. The game is a spin-off from Sega's Hatsune Miku: Project DIVA series, and features Crypton Future Media's virtual singers Hatsune Miku, Megurine Luka, Kagamine Rin and Len, MEIKO, and KAITO, alongside the cast of 20 original human characters that are split into five units, each with a unique theme. Set in the real world where Virtual Singers only exist as fiction, the characters come across another world called "Sekai," where various "true feelings" are projected. The game was released for Android and Apple devices on September 30, 2020. It was developed with Unity, and uses the Piapro Studio NT engine for voice synthesis.</p>

        <p>A series of rhythm games starting from Hatsune Miku: Project DIVA were produced by Sega under license using Hatsune Miku and other Crypton Vocaloids, as well as "fan-made" Vocaloids like Akita Neru. The series has sold 6 million copies.[78]] Later on, a mobile gacha rhythm game called Project SEKAI: Colorful Stage! (marketed as Hatsune Miku: Colorful Stage! outside of Asia) was released. The game features Miku as well as the other Crypton Vocaloids alongside original human characters. Many of the game's playable songs are covers of existing Vocaloid originals.
